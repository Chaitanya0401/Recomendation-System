# Recomendation-System
In this project I have made a simple content based and a collaborative filtering based recomendation system to recomend movies to the users.

Content-based filtering uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback.

Collaborative filtering is also known as social filtering. Collaborative filtering uses algorithms to filter data from user reviews to make personalized recommendations for users with similar preferences. Collaborative filtering is also used to select content and advertising for individuals on social media.
